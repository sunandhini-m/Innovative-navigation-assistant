Frequent navigation checks on the roads while driving has become a major trouble for the common public these days. Riders feel inconvenient to constantly pick their phone up, from the pocket and check for their route which could as well cause accidents. This could also lead someone not to follow traffic rules. This problem can even be extended to the category of food/goods delivery, cab and auto rickshaw service persons. For an instance, let us consider that a food delivery person is sent to an unfamiliar place for delivery, then making frequent navigation checks causes discomfort to the driver and he may even run out of delivery time. In order to overcome this problem, we have designed a pair of gloves which are capable of navigating the riders through LED indications from the Gloves. This can greatly reduce the burden on the riders who constantly check for the route and ensure safety on roads. This application can even be extended to visually challenged persons, with the help of these gloves visually challenged persons can effectively aid them on the pavements and can make their journeys safer. In future, we want to add NFC feature with gloves for making payments easier as well. In short, this glove will help you reach the destination safely while letting other commuters also to be safe.
